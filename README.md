## Primary Question: What influences happiness?
- Tobacco consumption
- GDP
- Regional differences(?)

## Secondary Question: Happiness over time?
- Is there one region that stands out over time?

### Graph ideas
- PCA etc. (Tassilo)
- Internet use on a regional basis normalised for GDP (Conor)
- Line plot of Countries with additional trend lines for regions against time
- Geography plot of happiness
- (Conor) I would like to look at the countries that had the biggest swings in happiness between 2016-22, plot their changes and see can we see were there specific events which caused this *

## Report Order
- Opening Questions (Map of Happiness)
- (T) Datasets and pre-processing
- (T) Preliminary analyses - Boxplots, scale data?, correlation matrices, regression, PCA (Colour by region) + biplot (or PLS), and SOM (2018) 
- Over time analysis *
- (C) 2018 specific influences
- Future work
