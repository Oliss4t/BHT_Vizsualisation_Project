       "'Pearse Doherty (Donegal, Sinn Fein)\\n\\nLink to this: Individually | In context\\n\\nNíl dabht ar bith ach go bhfuil an ghéarchéim sa chostas maireachtála ag tiomáint níos mó agus níos mó teaghlaigh go dtí pointe na bochtaineachta, agus nár oibrigh an méid atá déanta ag an Rialtas go dtí seo. Tá rudaí ag dul ó olc go holc agus tá daoine ag streachailt chun íoc as earraí riachtanacha. Tá sé in am do cháinaisnéis éigeandála, a chuirfidh airgead ar ais i bpócaí gnáthdhaoine na tíre seo. The soaring cost of living now has many workers and families at breaking point. On radio this morning we heard testimonies from people who face heartbreaking choices to make it to the end of the week. We heard about families having to go without breakfast, children going without cereal. We heard of a mother talk of her child, saying he has a hole in his shoe and having to tell him he will have to wait for another pair. Parents spoke of the pressure they feel when their children come home and tell them they are going on a school tour. A child going on a school tour should not be a household crisis, but it is for too many. But this is now the hard experience of so many people. The cost of living crisis is pushing more and more people to the edge of poverty. Food poverty is now a feature of life for an ever-growing number of children. The growing need for foodbanks is a stark testament to this reality right across the State. A foodbank in the midlands is now feeding up to 5,000 people and it expects that figure to rise to 15,000 over the next period. Those who never thought they would need such help are now standing in queues waiting to be fed by charities. People are working long hours, and the soaring costs mean that they simply cannot get by. It is soul-destroying. As families keep an eye to every euro they spend, yesterday the Taoiseach told them to prepare for a rocky road ahead, to be ready for a new era of high fuel and energy costs. This is astonishing because workers and families have been walking the rocky road of extortionate fuel and energy costs for the best part of a year now. To tell people, as he did, who are already struggling to pay their bills that they will have to tighten their belts even further is painfully out of touch, while at the same time ruling out from him as Taoiseach further Government action until October at the very earliest. Does this Government understand the pressure that real families and workers are under right across the State? We are talking about households who have to deal with rip-off rents, food prices that are increasing sharply, big energy bills and childcare fees that cost a second mortgage for many. People cannot catch their breath. They cannot catch a break. Many are having to choose between having lunch or filling the car to go to work, and now prices at the pumps are shooting up once again.\\n\\nThe Government\\'s approach to this crisis has failed. It has been piecemeal, slow and sluggish and its measures have not made a dent in the costs people face. So now is the time for a real and comprehensive plan of action. We need a mini budget right now aimed at getting costs down right across the board. There is room within the public finances for the Government to act, and it is not just me and Sinn Féin saying that. That is also the view of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and also the view of the Central Bank, so you need to listen. You need to listen to what families have been saying on \"Morning Ireland\" this morning, families who are coming to all our constituency offices. They are telling you loud and clear, they cannot hang on for another five months. The Taoiseach and his Government need to understand where people are at. They need to do what is necessary and to bring forward a mini budget to deal with this crisis.'"

       " 'rede': 'Wir müssen aber auch Kontrolle üben und Vorbereitungen treffen. Zum einen müssen wir kontrollieren, ob die Einschränkungen, die beschlossen wurden, auch eingehalten werden, und zum anderen Vorbereitungen dafür treffen, dass in Phasen ein öffentliches Leben unter Einhaltung der Vorkehrungen zur Eindämmung der Ausbreitung möglich ist. Vor allem müssen wir durch die Mobilität und die Logistik aber auch die Versorgung garantieren und die Ausübung der notwendigen beruflichen Arbeit bzw. Tätigkeit gewährleisten. Wir müssen Rücksicht und Disziplin üben: Rücksicht auf den Nächsten und Disziplin im eigenen Verhalten. Deswegen möchte ich sehr herzlich allen Bürgerinnen und Bürgern danken, die so umsichtig sind, den Vorkehrungen, die die Politik entschieden und beschlossen hat, Rechnung zu tragen. Dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger das in einem so breiten Konsens mittragen, ist die Basis dafür, dass das Virus sich nicht zusätzlich ausbreitet. Wir als Bundesregierung informieren das Parlament gerne, nicht nur durch die vielen Staatssekretäre und Staatsminister, sondern heute auch – in kollegialer Zusammenarbeit – durch den Bundesgesundheitsminister. Vielleicht gab es bei dem einen oder anderen noch Informationsdefizite, was das Verkehrsministerium in so einer Krise alles machen muss, um die Lieferketten aufrechtzuerhalten, die Versorgung in den Supermärkten sicherzustellen und eine stabile Grundversorgung durch die Verkehrsmittel zu erreichen, beispielsweise bei der Fernbahn und den Regionalzügen. Wir arbeiten jetzt beispielsweise daran, verschiedene Szenarien einzuphasen. Wenn nämlich die Ministerpräsidenten und die Kultusminister darüber reden, dass der Schulunterricht wieder aufgenommen werden soll, dann ist es schon entscheidend, wie der Schüler von seiner eigenen Haustür zur Schultür kommt, und deshalb ist es notwendig, mit den Busunternehmen und den kommunalen Verkehrsbetrieben zu reden und vieles mehr zu organisieren. Meine Damen und Herren, ich kümmere mich gerne darum, dass jetzt zusammen mit dem Bundesgesundheitsministerium die Beschaffung von Schutzausrüstung noch zusätzlich über eine Landbrücke angereichert wird. Heute fährt der erste Zug von China nach Deutschland los, und das in wöchentlichem Turnus, mit mehreren Millionen Schutzartikeln nicht nur für Deutschland, sondern auch – meine Damen und Herren, das freut mich ganz besonders – mit Schutzgütern und medizinischen Gütern für Italien. Das ist eine sehr, sehr gute Botschaft, und zwar neben der Luftbrücke. Die Bemühungen dazu haben wir gemeinsam intensiviert. Wir haben gemeinsam geschaut, dass Start- und Landerechte gewährleistet sind, dass die Crews getestet sind und vieles mehr, dass wir die Lieferketten in vielen, vielen Belangen aufrechterhalten. Zusammen mit dem Bundeswirtschaftsminister stehen wir dazu in intensivem Kontakt, um Leben in Deutschland vorsichtig und diszipliniert zu ermöglichen, aber um vor allem auch die Produktion wieder anlaufen zu lassen. Wir haben bei der Bahn grenzüberschreitende Verkehre beim Warentransport. Die DB Cargo fährt sehr viele Verkehre. Das ist gut so; denn es werden mittlerweile auch Güter gefahren, die normalerweise nicht auf der Schiene transportiert werden, also auch Güter, die im Supermarkt zu finden sind und normalerweise mit anderen Verkehrsmitteln transportiert werden. Ich kann Ihnen noch eine sehr gute Botschaft über ein neues Förderprogramm für unsere Krankenschwestern und das Personal im Pflegedienst, aber vor allem auch in den Testlabors geben. Wir werden nächste Woche ein Förderprogramm starten, mit dem es ermöglicht wird, dass diese Beschäftigten auf die Mietwagenunternehmen zugehen und Mietwagen für ihre eigene Mobilität buchen können, damit sie von zu Hause sicher ins Krankenhaus oder ins Pflegeheim kommen. Ich glaube, das ist eine sehr, sehr gute Botschaft. Das ist eine Win-win-Situation. Die Mietwagenunternehmen spüren die Krise massiv. Deswegen gibt es da freie Kapazitäten, die wir mit diesem Förderprogramm nutzen können. Darüber hinaus gibt es auch eine gute Botschaft für die Taxiunternehmen. Wir haben mit den Taxiunternehmen gesprochen und Schutzvorrichtungen eingeführt, deren Einbau wir auch fördern werden, damit zwischen der normalen Fahrgastebene und dem Fahrer eine Trennwand eingefügt wird, aber nicht mit Plexiglas und anderen starren Dingen, wie man sie vielleicht aus dem Ausland kennt, sondern mit einer Art Folie – es gibt entsprechende Nachbausysteme –, und zwar eine stärkere, transparente Folie, die dann dazu führt, dass der Fahrgast und der Fahrer gegenseitig geschützt sind. Darüber haben wir uns mit vielen Verbänden aus der Wirtschaft sehr, sehr intensiv ausgetauscht. Wir haben vor allem auch ein stabiles Grundangebot über die verschiedenen Verkehrsträger gewährleistet und werden jetzt in die nächste Phase kommen, nämlich ein Grundangebot plus. Zum Schluss, Herr Präsident, möchte ich mich noch mal ganz herzlich bei allen bedanken, die in der Logistik tätig sind: bei den Lageristen, bei den Gabelstaplerfahrern, aber vor allem auch bei unseren Brummifahrern, dass sie diesen harten Job machen. Wir konnten ihnen dabei helfen, dass alle Rastanlagen und Autohöfe offen sind, die sanitäre Infrastruktur vorgehalten wird und auch die Verpflegung sichergestellt ist. Ihnen möchte ich herzlichen Dank sagen. Ich danke Ihnen für die Aufmerksamkeit.',\n",
